> so upperface is an incredible invention devised by none other than @benja in this group chat itself. in theory, it uses advanced string algorithms to find and replace the first character of any chain of characters with it's uppercase counterpart. For example, say we had the string "hello world". Using upperface we could convert this to "Hello world". Notice how the first letter is now uppercase. This is due to the advanced string algorithms implemented in this package. I have been searching for a package like this for nineteen years and I am happy to have found this one today. Thank you benja.
